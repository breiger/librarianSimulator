This is a text-based game written in Javascript. It is still a work in progress. 

Version 1.5 adds support for a player inventory. 

Might need to move some of the text processing from the libary.js file to the player object itself. 

Might need to restructure the loop of the game to run through every person in the game in order to check intentions and execute actions. 

TODO: Create arrays of synonmyms for each of the major actions. Loop search will then search each array and then return the major action. Example go = ["walk", ["go", "travel", "run", etc...]];
